# RoboEliminartorV1
In this project, I have created a 3D environment in the Unity-3D platform, where a robot learns to eliminate humanoid robots using reinforcement learning and Unity-ML. The robot observes the surrounding environment and learns based on a reward function that penalizes the robot if it falls from the plane and gives a reward for every elimination. The update policy used for training the robot is Proximal Policy Optimization.
